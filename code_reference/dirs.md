# Module Description:  dirs.py<br/>

## Overview

dirs.py uses python’s pathlib library to construct three Path objects –<br/>
local_dir, a path to the [project_scripts](../project_scripts/) directory; json_dir, a path to<br/>
the [json_files](../json_files/) directory; and events_dir, a path to the [event_files](../event_files/)<br/>
directory.  The columns, frame_functions, retro_object, and teams<br/>
modules import these paths.<br/>
